            Hello, my name is Max and I want to successfully pass this interview. I study at BSUIR in this
             University I got acquainted with programming.My way as a programmer started with C++ it was 
             very exciting but I wanted something more than homework at the University. My friends advised 
             me to get acquainted with html/css/javascript. It captured me, but the summer session did not 
             allow me to devote much time to programming. In September I saw information about Ruby courses 
             at my University.   It was a very interesting experience, I really liked this language and now 
             I have a high motivation to become a Ruby developer. I am ready to work a lot on myself because 
             I have a great desire to connect my life with the IT-sphere. Thank you for listening.
